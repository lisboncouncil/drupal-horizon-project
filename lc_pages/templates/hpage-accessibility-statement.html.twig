<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>{{ site_name | upper }} (“the Website”) is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for all users, including people with disabilities. We strive to comply with the European Accessibility Act (EAA) and with the European standard EN 301 549 v3.2.1, which incorporates the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA requirements. This accessibility statement applies to all pages and content published on the Website.</p>
<h2>2. Scope</h2>

    <li>Multimedia components (videos, images, audio).</li>

</ul>
<h2>3. Compliance Status</h2>

<h2>4. Measures to Support Accessibility</h2>
<p>To achieve and maintain compliance with EN 301 549 v3.2.1 and the EAA, Lisbon Council has implemented the following measures:</p>
<ol>
    <li><p><strong>Governance &amp; Oversight</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accessibility Coordinator:</strong> A designated Accessibility Officer (AO) is responsible for overseeing compliance, coordinating audits, and managing remediation tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Internal Policies:</strong> Accessibility requirements are included in our web‐development guidelines and procurement policies for third-party tools.</li>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Technical Implementation</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Code Standards:</strong> All new templates and components are audited against EN 301 549 (WCAG 2.1 AA).</li>
            <li><strong>Design System:</strong> Our design system uses accessible color palettes (contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 for normal text), semantic HTML5 markup, and ARIA attributes where needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Testing Tools:</strong> We employ automated scanners (e.g., Lighthouse, axe, WAVE) and manual testing (keyboard‐only navigation, screen reader verification with NVDA and VoiceOver).</li>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Content Creation</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Editorial Training:</strong> Content authors receive training on creating accessible text, lists, headings, and tables, writing meaningful link text, and providing alt attributes.</li>
            <li><strong>Multimedia:</strong> All newly uploaded videos include captions and/or full transcripts. Audio files have transcripts available for download.</li>
            <li><strong>PDF Remediation:</strong> All published PDF documents follow best practices for tagging (headings, lists, tables, image descriptions).</li>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Continuous Monitoring &amp; Review</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Periodic Audits:</strong> We perform accessibility audits - at least yearly - combining automated tools and manual testing.</li>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Accessibility as part of the organisational culture</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>  In the Lisbon Council, internal training will take place on accessibility to ensure that all staff members have at least basic knowledge in accessibility.</li>

        </ul>
    </li>

</ol>
